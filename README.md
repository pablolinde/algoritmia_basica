# basic_algorithms

This repository includes some basic algorithmic implementations.

The Avance_rapido code assigns tasks to machines by minimizing the total time with a heuristic approach, and it includes a validation script.
The Backtracking script divides participants into two balanced teams using backtracking to explore combinations and dynamic programming (memoization) for optimization.
The Dividiryvencer notebook discusses search and optimization algorithms using a divide and conquer approach, generating graphs and finding optimal routes under constraints.
