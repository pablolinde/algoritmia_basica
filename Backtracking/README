Problem:  
Computer science students are organizing a tug-of-war competition. In this game, participants must be divided into two teams. 
Each person can only belong to one team. The number of participants on each team cannot differ by more than one, 
and the total weight of the members of each team should be as similar as possible.

Input:  
The input starts with a single positive integer indicating the number of test cases. 
Each test case is preceded by a blank line, and there will be a blank line between consecutive test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains n, the number of participants. 
The next n lines contain the weight of each person (from person 1 to person n). 
Each weight is an integer between 1 and 450, and there can be up to 30 participants.

Output:  
For each test case, output a single line with two numbers: the total weight of the members in one team and the total weight 
of the members in the other team. If the weights are different, display the smaller number first.

Example Input:  
1  
3  
100  
90  
200  

Example Output:  
190 200
